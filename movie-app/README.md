 After the tutorial on [freecodecamp](freecodecamp.org/news/react-movie-app-tutorial/).

 ## API Keys
 You need to register for an API key, as per the instructions on the Freecodecamp tutorial. Once you have an API key, placed it in the Constants file.

 ## UI Styling Issues
 This is a fairly old tutorial so the styling doesn't look amazing. My main purpose was to get some practice with API calls via React, so I didn't fix the UI. 

 ## Final thoughts
 I fixed some minor bugs with the local storage whereby the favourites were stored before they were extant and there wasn't a check for that. It's working now.
